Classes vs Hooks
// Classes vs Hooks

Many ways to build components, one of them is hooks
Hooks are fairly new and exciting
Also react specific
Classes are part of Javascript

Hooks 

Because hooks are fairly new, we will learn about classes first 

Some people are shying away from hooks because of the complexity 

function App()

This is called a functional component

We will change to a class 

class App extends React.component {
	render()
}

and add import React from 'react';

This way we change from a functional component to a class component

Now we are using the react package we installed
using the class component
This gives us the power to use the package 

It will run the render and return something
It will return the view 

All the magic is in the react component
